		<p class="flex-item">Hi, I'm Dan Friedman. I'm a senior at Yale University. I put together this website to showcase some of the things I've been working on, mostly JavaScript web applications for doing interesting things with the browser. You can also look at my resume, <a href="resume/resume.pdf">as a PDF</a> or <a href="resume/resume.html">in HTML.</a></p>

			<h2>Kineograph</h2>
			
			<p>Kineograph is a JavaScript web app for making flipbook-style animations in the browser. I used to do some animation with Adobe Flash but my access code expired and Flash is on its way out anyway, so I wrote Kineograph as a kind of replacement. Kineograph supports onion-skinning and layers, so you can actually make fairly sophisticated animations if you're interested and then export your animation as a gif.</p>

			<p>I wrote Kineograph in JavaScript/JQuery using the HTML Canvas API. You can play with Kineograph <a href="/kineograph">here</a> and look at the source code <a href="https://github.com/danfriedman0/kineograph">on GitHub</a>.</p>

			<h2>turnStyle</h2>
			
			<p>turnStyle is a Google Chrome extension that lets you override websites with your own style rules. You can write your own CSS in the extension popup or in a style manager and then save your rules and apply them to any website. turnStyle saves your settings in Chrome storage, so your settings are synchronized across all your devices. I made the extension because I use a bunch of websites written in unformatted HTML, which is not very easy to read (e.g., <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/pericles/full.html">this</a>). turnStyle makes it easy to add basic styles that make those sites more readable. It's also a good way to hide content you find noxious (<code>.noxious-content { display: none !important; }</code>). I think turnStyle can have accessibility applications, too, for increasing text size or making websites high-contrast.</p>

			<p>I wrote turnStyle in Vanilla JS. It's in the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/turnstyle/mcclmlgcklibbacamgggjlllfcpodaij">Chrome Web Store</a> and the source code is <a href="https://github.com/danfriedman0/turnStyle">on GitHub.</a>

			<h2>imageMapWrapper</h2>

			<p>imageMapWrapper is a JQuery plug-in that adds some functionality to HTML image maps. For example, it makes image maps responsive and it lets you highlight different areas. I built a "view from your section" tool for the <a href="http://kentuckycenter.org">Kentucky Center for the Performing Arts</a>, to map photographs to seatmaps. I couldn't find a plug-in I liked so I made this one.</p>

			<p>imageMapWrapper uses the HTML Canvas API. There's a little demo <a href="/imageMapWrapper">here</a> and the source code is <a href="https://github.com/danfriedman0/imageMapWrapper">on GitHub</a>.</p>
